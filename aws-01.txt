What is IT Infrastructure ?
=============================

=> To run a software company then we need to purchase below resources

		a) machines
		b) network
		c) power
		d) storage
		e) backup
		f) security

=> The above resources are called as IT infrastructure.

=> We can maintain infrastructure in 2 ways

		a) On-Prem infrastructure		
		b) Cloud infrastructure	

==================================
What is On-Prem Infrastructure ?
==================================		

=> On-Prem means we need to purchase and we need to maintain our resources to run our business.

=> We have several challenges with On-Prem infrastructure

		1) Lot of money investement
		2) Lot of man power
		3) Scalability (increase / decrease)
		4) Availability
		5) Network issues
		6) Security issues

=> To overcome the problems of on-prem infrastructure companies are preferring Cloud Infrastructure.

===========================
What is Cloud Computing ?
===========================

=> The process of delivering IT resources over the internet on demand basis is called as Cloud Computing.

=> We have below advantages with cloud computing.

		- Pay as you go
		- Less cost
		- Scalability
		- Availability
		- Security
		- Backup

Note: Cloud computing works based on pay as you go model.

================
Cloud Providers
================

=> The companies which are providing IT infrastructure based on "pay as you go" model are called as Cloud Providers.

1) Amazon (AWS)

2) Microsoft (Azure)

3) Google (GCP)

4) Salesforce

5) Ali Baba

6) Digital Ocean

=======================
Cloud Service Models
=======================

=> We have 3 types cloud service models

	1) IAAS

	2) PAAS

	3) SAAS

=============
What is IaaS
=============

=> IAAS stands for infrastructure as a service

=> Provider will give infrastructure for us

	Ex: Machines, Network, Storage

=> As a customer we need to prepare platform to run our application

  Ex: install required softwares + setup web servers + deploy application.

  	Ex: EC2, VPC

=============
What is PaaS
=============   

=> PaaS stands for Platform as a service

=> Provider will give ready made platform to run our application directley.

=> As a customer we need to take care of only our application deployment.

	Ex: Beanstack, Lambdas ...

=================
What is SaaS

=> SaaS stands for software as a service

-> Cloud Provider will give their application to run our business.

		36 - Regions

		112 - Availability Zones		

===============
